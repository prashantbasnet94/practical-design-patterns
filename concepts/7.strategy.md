# 7. Strategy Pattern

## Definition
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Real-World Use Case in This Repo
The `AuthProvider` configuration supports multiple strategies (Email/Password, Google OAuth, Microsoft OAuth). The system is designed so you can swap out strict password rules for OAuth without changing the core login flow logic.

## Your Challenge
**Goal:** Implement a generic `PaymentContext` that accepts different payment strategies.

1.  Create a file named `7.strategy.ts`.
2.  Define an interface `PaymentStrategy` with method `pay(amount: number): void`.
3.  Implement `CreditCardStrategy`: logs "Paid $X with Credit Card".
4.  Implement `PayPalStrategy`: logs "Paid $X with PayPal".
5.  Implement `CryptoStrategy`: logs "Paid $X with Bitcoin".
6.  Create a `Checkout` class that takes a `PaymentStrategy` in its constructor (or a setter).
7.  **Verify:** Create a checkout with CreditCard, process `100`. Then change strategy to PayPal, process `50`.

### Bonus
Factory + Strategy: Use a factory function to return the correct Strategy instance based on a user string "paypal" or "cc".
