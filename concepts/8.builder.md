# 8. Builder Pattern

## Definition
The **Builder Pattern** separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows you to create different representations using the same construction process, often via method chaining.

## Real-World Use Case in This Repo
We use **Drizzle ORM** extensively, which uses a query builder pattern:
```typescript
db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, 1));
```
This is much safer and cleaner than concatenating SQL strings manually.

## Your Challenge
**Goal:** Implement a `PizzaBuilder` to construct a custom pizza object.

1.  Create a file named `8.builder.ts`.
2.  Define a class `Pizza` with properties: `size`, `cheese`, `pepperoni`, `mushrooms`.
3.  Create a `PizzaBuilder` class.
    *   Methods: `setSize(size)`, `addCheese()`, `addPepperoni()`, `addMushrooms()`.
    *   Each method should return `this` (the builder instance) to allow chaining.
    *   Method `build()` returns the final `Pizza` object.
4.  **Verify:** `new PizzaBuilder().setSize('large').addCheese().addPepperoni().build()`.

### Bonus
Ensure that `build()` throws an error if `setSize()` was never called (validation during build step).
