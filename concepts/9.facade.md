# 9. Facade Pattern

## Definition
The **Facade Pattern** provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. It hides the complexity of the subsystem from the client.

## Real-World Use Case in This Repo
Our `ServiceFactory` acts as a massive Facade. When the `OrganizationController` needs to work, it just asks `ServiceFactory.getInstance().getOrgService()`. It doesn't need to know that `OrgService` depends on `OrgRepository`, which depends on `MetricsBus` and `DatabaseConnection`. The Factory/Facade hides that wiring complexity.

## Your Challenge
**Goal:** Create a `ComputerFacade` that turns on the computer by coordinating sub-parts.

1.  Create a file named `9.facade.ts`.
2.  Create complex subsystem classes with `start()` methods: `CPU`, `Memory`, `HardDrive`.
3.  Create a `ComputerFacade` class.
    *   Constructor initializes the subsystems.
    *   Method `startComputer()` calls:
        1.  `CPU.freeze()`
        2.  `Memory.load(BOOT_ADDRESS)`
        3.  `HardDrive.read(BOOT_SECTOR)`
        4.  `CPU.jump(BOOT_ADDRESS)`
        5.  `CPU.execute()`
4.  **Verify:** The client just calls `computer.startComputer()` and sees the sequence of logs.

### Bonus
Consider if the Facade should expose access to the underlying subsystems or keep them strictly private.
