# 4. Composite Pattern

## Definition
The **Composite Pattern** allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Real-World Use Case in This Repo
In `src/infrastructure/logging/composite.logging.writer.ts`, the `CompositeLoggingWriter` holds a list of other writers. When `write()` is called on it, it iterates and calls `write()` on all children. The client using it doesn't know (or care) if it's talking to one logger or five.

## Your Challenge
**Goal:** Build a `FileSystem` structure where `Folder` and `File` are treated uniformly.

1.  Create a file named `4.composite.ts`.
2.  Define an interface `FileSystemComponent` with a method `getSize(): number`.
3.  Implement `File` class:
    *   Constructor takes a `size: number`.
    *   `getSize()` returns that size.
4.  Implement `Folder` class:
    *   Holds a list of `FileSystemComponent` children.
    *   Has an `add(component: FileSystemComponent)` method.
    *   `getSize()` returns the **sum** of all children's sizes.
5.  **Verify:** Create a folder `root`, add two files (size 10 and 20), and a subfolder with one file (size 5). `root.getSize()` should return 35.

### Bonus
Add a `printName()` method to the interface. `Folder` should print its name and then indent + recurse for children.
