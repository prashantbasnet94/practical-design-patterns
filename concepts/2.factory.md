# 2. Factory Method Pattern

## Definition
The **Factory Method Pattern** defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses or helper functions decide which class to instantiate. It defers instantiation to the factory, decoupling the client code from specific class logic.

## Real-World Use Case in This Repo
In `src/infrastructure/logging/composite.logging.writer.ts`, the `createCompositeLoggingWriter` function acts as a factory. It decides whether to compose just a `ConsoleWriter`, or add a `SentryWriter` and `PostHogWriter` based on the configuration object passed to it.

## Your Challenge
**Goal:** Create a `LoggerFactory` that handles different logging destinations.

1.  Create a file named `2.factory.ts`.
2.  Define an interface `ILogger` with a method `log(message: string): void`.
3.  Implement three classes implementing `ILogger`:
    *   `ConsoleLogger`: Prints to `console.log`.
    *   `FileLogger`: Simulates writing to a file (just print "[File] ...").
    *   `CloudLogger`: Simulates sending to AWS (just print "[Cloud] ...").
4.  Create a function/class `LoggerFactory` that takes a type string (`'console' | 'file' | 'cloud'`) and returns the correct `ILogger` instance.
5.  **Verify:** Call your factory request a 'cloud' logger and verify the output.

### Bonus
Add a configuration object to the factory so that if `env: 'production'` is passed, it forces 'cloud' logging regardless of the requested type.
