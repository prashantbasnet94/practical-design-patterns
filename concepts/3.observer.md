# 3. Observer Pattern (Pub/Sub)

## Definition
The **Observer Pattern** (often implemented as Publish/Subscribe) defines a mechanism for a "Subject" to notify a list of "Observers" about state changes, generally via events strings. This decouples the modules emitting events from the modules reacting to them.

## Real-World Use Case in This Repo
In `src/infrastructure/metrics/metrics.bus.ts`, the `MetricsBus` is a classic Pub/Sub implementation. Services like `UserService` emit events (e.g., "User Created"), and the `MetricsBus` buffers and dispatches these to registered listeners (like Sentry or Logger) without the `UserService` knowing who is listening.

## Your Challenge
**Goal:** Build a simple `EventBus` for an E-commerce system.

1.  Create a file named `3.observer.ts`.
2.  Define a class `EventBus`.
3.  Implement a method `subscribe(event: string, callback: Function)`.
4.  Implement a method `publish(event: string, data: any)`.
5.  **Usage Scenario:**
    *   An "OrderService" publishes `ORDER_PLACED`.
    *   An "EmailService" (subscriber) listens and logs "Sending confirmation email...".
    *   An "InventoryService" (subscriber) listens and logs "Deducting stock...".
6.  **Verify:** Trigger one publish and ensure both subscribers react.

### Bonus
Implement an `unsubscribe` method that removes a specific callback from the listener list.
